# 10 Tips for Thinking like a Programmer


1. Think about how your task can be converted into coding terms
   - If you can master this, 80% of your work is already done 
   - For example:
     -  Speed = double/float
     -  A button toggle = bool
     -  Constantly perform a task = a while loop / new thread

2. Think about your past work and if it can be reused
   - Ask yourself, "Is what I'm trying to do similar to anything I've made similar in the past?"
   - If you answered yes to that question, don't be afraid to reuse code

3. Break down tasks into their smallest components
   - Make functions do one thing only
   - If a function is too large, break it into sub functions
     - This improves readability
   - A single large function that controls the robot with a controller can be broken down into
     - Driving
       - Grabbing input from the controller
       - Setting the motor speeds
     - Other things

4. Organize your priorities
   - Your priotities for code should follow this order
      1. Does it work?
      2. Is it readable?
      3. Is it good?
   - Premature optimizations should always be avoided

5. Consider how other people would read your code
   - Making your code readable for other people will also make it readable for you if you take a break from your project
   - Be sure to comment your functions

6. Accept failure
   - 90% of the time code won't work first try

7. Try to apply common code patterns to your project
   - Learning common code patterns makes tons of projects easy
 
8. Try to make future you's job easier
   - Making variables accessible and tweaks easy to make will save you time in the long run

9. Consider dependancy
   - Make sure you know what a block of code affects before you change it

10. Have Fun
   - Coding doesn't have to be a boring task
