Hey Nerds!

If you're reading this it's probably because your team is making you take up the role of team progammer. Either that, or you geniuenly have an interest in computer science, both are valid. Well your here now so let's get into some prerequisites. 

First off, I'll be using c++ for this tutorial but some of the topics/concepts can also be applied to python. Also if you're planning to use this library you're gonna have to use the Vex visual studio code extension. The added complexity and having to set up motors manually are some downsides, but visual studio's intelisense and it's other features are worth it.
