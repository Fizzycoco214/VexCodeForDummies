Hey Nerds!

If you're reading this it's probably because your team is making you take up the role of team progammer. Either that, or you geniuenly have an interest in computer science, both are valid. Well your here now so let's get into some prerequisites. 

First off, I'll be using c++ for this tutorial but some of the topics/concepts can also be applied to python. Also if you're planning to use this library you're gonna have to use the Vex visual studio code extension. The added complexity and having to set up motors manually are some downsides, but visual studio's intelisense and it's other features are worth it. So lets get started with...

# Syntax

Syntax is the grammar of a programming language. Here's what a line of c++ looks like:  

`Brain.Screen.print("Hello World!");`  

Let's break down this line of code. We start with `Brain.Screen.print`. The . can be thought of as going into a folder on a computer, so this part in english translates to "In the brain, go to the screen. In the screen, print ...". 

Then, we move onto `print("Hello World!")`. This is called a function, which performs some action, in this case printing some text to the screen. After print, we then give it some text inside the `()`. Things given to a function inside the `()` are called arguments, some functions require them and some don't. With this, our english translation for this line becomes "In the brain, go to the screen. In the screen, print "Hello World!".

Finally we get to the semicolon. **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T FORGET THE SEMICOLON.**  `;` acts as the period of c++. It basically tells the computer that your done with that command.
